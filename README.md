The Project consists of a Blog for Cats lovers, where you can post interesting articles about cats, have a personalized to do list for grooming your cat, log in and register.

The Website is divided by different tabs: 
~The Homepage that displays the articles, 
~The My To Do List page shows a dynamic table where you can add, remove or update tasks, 
~The Log In and ~Register Page for signing and logging up.

Beside this project, I also did a website created in Webflow, here, I applied what I learned more from LU Fundamentals of HTML / CSS. This is mentioned in the reflection essay file.
